# @did-btcr2/aggregation

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Authenticate EXTERNAL (x1) did:btcr2 identifiers on the aggregation HTTP transport (ADR 066)

  EXTERNAL (x1) DIDs can now join aggregation cohorts as first-class members over the HTTP
  transport, the way KEY (k1) DIDs already do. An x1 DID commits to the hash of its genesis
  document, so the controller carries that self-verifying genesis in-band on the cohort opt-in;
  the service recomputes the hash, derives the communication key from `capabilityInvocation[0]`
  (no `verificationMethod[0]` fallback), cross-checks it against the advertised
  `communicationPk`, verifies the envelope signature, and only then registers the peer. There
  is no trust-on-first-use.

  - `@did-btcr2/method`: `resolveBtcr2SenderPk(did, { genesisDocument })` is now genesis-aware
    (the one-argument form is unchanged: k1 to key, x1 to undefined), and a new exported
    `getAggregationCommunicationKey(document)` derives the aggregation communication key from
    `capabilityInvocation[0]`.
  - `@did-btcr2/aggregation`: the cohort opt-in body carries an optional `genesisDocument`; the
    HTTP server bootstraps an unregistered x1 sender from it, binds the inner `message.from` to
    the authenticated `envelope.from`, registers a bootstrapped peer only after the request
    clears every gate, and accepts a new `maxBodyBytes` transport option (413 on oversize). The
    package remains method-agnostic.

  Backward compatible: existing k1 opt-ins, one-argument resolver callers, and older
  participants are unaffected.
