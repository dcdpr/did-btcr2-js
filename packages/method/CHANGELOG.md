### Minor Changes

- Fix resolver duplicate-update confirmation so a re-announced update no longer bricks resolution (ADR 067)

  A confirmed duplicate update (the same version announced more than once on chain, for
  example on two of a k1 DID's own beacons or replayed by a third party at another derivable
  beacon address) no longer advances the version counter. `Resolver.updates()` now increments
  `current_version_id`, and the `versionId` it reports, only on the apply path, and confirms a
  duplicate against the update-hash history without appending to it. This removes a `versionId`
  inflation that mis-classified the next genuine update and raised a false `LATE_PUBLISHING_ERROR`,
  bricking an otherwise-valid linear history in a single discovery round and across rounds. The
  duplicate-confirmation guard still rejects an update that claims an already-used version but
  carries different content. This is a deliberate, traced deviation from the current spec prose on
  when the counter increments, pursued upstream as a spec erratum; see ADR 067.

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- Authenticate EXTERNAL (x1) did:btcr2 identifiers on the aggregation HTTP transport (ADR 066)

  EXTERNAL (x1) DIDs can now join aggregation cohorts as first-class members over the HTTP
  transport, the way KEY (k1) DIDs already do. An x1 DID commits to the hash of its genesis
  document, so the controller carries that self-verifying genesis in-band on the cohort opt-in;
  the service recomputes the hash, derives the communication key from `capabilityInvocation[0]`
  (no `verificationMethod[0]` fallback), cross-checks it against the advertised
  `communicationPk`, verifies the envelope signature, and only then registers the peer. There
  is no trust-on-first-use.

  - `@did-btcr2/method`: `resolveBtcr2SenderPk(did, { genesisDocument })` is now genesis-aware
    (the one-argument form is unchanged: k1 to key, x1 to undefined), and a new exported
    `getAggregationCommunicationKey(document)` derives the aggregation communication key from
    `capabilityInvocation[0]`.
  - `@did-btcr2/aggregation`: the cohort opt-in body carries an optional `genesisDocument`; the
    HTTP server bootstraps an unregistered x1 sender from it, binds the inner `message.from` to
    the authenticated `envelope.from`, registers a bootstrapped peer only after the request
    clears every gate, and accepts a new `maxBodyBytes` transport option (413 on oversize). The
    package remains method-agnostic.

  Backward compatible: existing k1 opt-ins, one-argument resolver callers, and older
  participants are unaffected.
